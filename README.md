# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related features using multiple machine learning algorithms. The dataset was imbalanced, so preprocessing, undersampling, feature selection, scaling, and PCA were used before model training. The final model was deployed using **Gradio** for interactive usage.

## 🔍 Project Overview

### Key Objectives:
- Handle imbalanced data through **undersampling**
- Apply **feature scaling** and **PCA**
- Explore data through **EDA**
- Train and evaluate various ML algorithms
- Use metrics like **Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve**
- Select the best model (**Random Forest**) and deploy with **Gradio**

---

## 📊 Dataset

- The dataset contains various health indicators such as:
  - BMI, PhysicalHealth, MentalHealth, SleepTime, etc.
  - Target label: `HeartDisease` (binary classification)

---

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

1. **Handling Imbalance:**
   - The dataset was **imbalanced** toward one class.
   - We used **undersampling** to balance the classes.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Used `SelectKBest` to rank features by importance.
   - Top features include `DiffWalking`, `PhysicalHealth`, `Diabetic`, etc.

3. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize the features.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** was used to reduce feature space.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizations used to understand class distribution and correlations.
   - Bar plots for feature importance and class comparisons.
